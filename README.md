# Refugee Waves
A trainee in Defense and International Management ends stuck in another country, and to leave it, will have to deal with a very thorny crisis: the refugee crisis. How will he manage the situation, the country and his mom's calling in the phone? Find out!

Or help us in finding out too, this is a project under construction :D

# Origins 
Game [originally made](http://globalgamejam.org/2017/games/refugee-waves) by [Cláuvin Erlan](https://github.com/Clauvin), [Verônica Sakane Matias](https://github.com/vsakane) and [Brian Confessor](https://github.com/bconfessor) to the [Global Game Jam](http://globalgamejam.org/) 2017. To call what they managed to create to the jam a game is a overstatement: it was a simulation without interactivity. But the team saw the potential in it and decided to keep working on it.
