# How to contribute

As it is now (2017 - 08 - 26) the project is in alpha state. There are some ways you can help (but first read the [https://github.com/Clauvin/RefugeeWaves/blob/master/CODE%20OF%20CONDUCT.md][Code of Conduct]:

# Brainstorming

The game's objective (to teach people about the refugee crisis through exploration and analysis) needs new ideas to be achieved. The mechanics will have to be retooled and improved, and in some cases discarded. Be civil while discussing ideas, and respectful towards other collaborators.

We also accept suggestions for improvements of the project as a whole, just be sure to check if the suggestion you will made hasn't been made before.

# Programming

Ideas will have to be prototyped and added to the game. Do your changes in a branch or fork and then send a pull request so we can analyse and discuss your improvements. Code conventions below:

- All code must be in English.
- Comments when needed, not when possible.
- Try to make the code readable by itself to minimize need of comments. Remember, this is an open source project: anyone can be the next person to read your code.
- We ident with one tab = four characters.


# Debugging

The game will need testing as is made. Debugging conventions below:

- Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/Clauvin/RefugeeWaves/issues).
- If an issue about the bug does not exist yet, create an issue for it.
- The issue needs to have a clear description. "Weird graphics glitch" is not clear, "the picture in the main menu is flickering when the cursor passes in a button" is.
- Try to give as much information as possible in the issue.
- Give information which enables someone trying to fix it to reproduce the bug.

Did you write a patch which fixes the bug?

- Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
- Ensure the description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
- Before submitting, please read the Programming part above to know more about coding conventions.

Thanks!
Clauvin, programmer.
