# How to contribute

As it is now (2017 - 08 - 26) the project is in alpha state. So, there are three main objectives to be achieved:

# Brainstorming

The game's objective (to teach people about the refugee crisis through exploration and analysis) needs new ideas to be achieved. The mechanics will have to be retooled and improved, and in some cases discarded. Be civil while discussing ideas, and respectful towards other collaborators.

# Programming

Ideas will have to be prototyped and added to the game. Do your changes in a branch or fork and then send a pull request so we can analyse and discuss your improvements. Code conventions below:

- All code must be in English.
- Comments when needed, not when possible.
- Try to make the code readable by itself to minimize need of comments. Remember, this is an open source project: anyone can be the next person to read your code.
- We ident with one tab = four characters.


# Debugging

The game will need testing as is made. Debugging conventions below:

- Create an issue for each bug found.
- The issue needs to have a clear description. "Weird graphics glitch" is not clear, "the picture in the main menu is flickering when the cursor passes in a button" is.
- Try to give as much information as possible in the issue. Version testes, what you did to trigger the bug, etc. Remember, it's through your information that someone will try to reproduce the bug to fix it.

Thanks!
Clauvin, programmer.
